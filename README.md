The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used for no known output.
A clustering algorithm will be selected to group the cryptocurrencies and final results will be presented through data visualizations. 
## Analysis process
1.Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2.Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3.Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4.Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
